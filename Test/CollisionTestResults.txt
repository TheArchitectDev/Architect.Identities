Collision test results
======================

The first number is the bit count of the initial random sequence each timestamp.
The second number is the bit count of the increment for subsequent random sequences on the same timestamp.
Note that the INCREMENT bit count is leading. (Only adding a bit to the increment is almost as effective as adding a bit to both. But only adding a bit to the initial is not.)
